# 🧠 VSD RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program – Student Journey

Hi! I'm currently participating in the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** and **IIT Gandhinagar**. This repository is my personal log of everything I’m learning—from installing tools to building a chip from scratch!

## 🎯 About the Program
This is a 20-week hands-on training program where students like me learn how to:
- Design a RISC-V based System-on-Chip (SoC)
- Go through the full ASIC flow: RTL → Synthesis → STA → Floorplanning → Routing → GDSII
- Use industry-grade tools and open-source platforms
- Contribute to India’s semiconductor mission: *From Silicon to Sovereignty*

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **EDA Tools:** OpenLane, Yosys, Magic, Ngspice, OpenSTA
- **PDKs:** SkyWater130 and SCL180nm
- **Languages:** Verilog, Tcl, Shell scripting

## 📚 Weekly Progress
- **Week 0:** Installed all required tools and set up the environment  
  *(Check out my screenshots and notes in the `WEEK 0` folder)*

More weekly updates coming soon as I progress through the program!

## 🙌 Acknowledgments
I’m grateful to:
- **Kunal Ghosh** and the **VSD team** for organizing this amazing program
- **IIT Gandhinagar** for supporting student-led tapeouts
- **Synopsys**, **Efabless**, and the broader VLSI community for providing tools and guidance
